3 Instruction types: R-type, I-type, and J-type.
R-type:
	R-type instructions refer to register type instruction. The most complex.
	add $rd, $rs, $rt
	where $rd refers to some register d. $rs, $rt are also registers.
	R[d] = R[s] + R[t]
	Addition.
I-type:
	I-type is short for "immediate type".
	lw/sw $1,1000($2)
	$1 <-- Mem[$2+1000]
	$1 --> Mem[$2+1000]
J-type:
	J-type is short for "jump type".
	j target
	Jump to instruction (not byte) target
